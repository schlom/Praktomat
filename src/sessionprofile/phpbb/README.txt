This directory contains the PHP code you need to make phpBB recognise users who
are logged into your website using Django.  There are four files:

* getdjangouser_mysql.php.  This file is for people who are using MySQL as their
  database, and provides a function that returns the Django username of the
  logged in user, or null if no-one is logged in.

* getdjangouser_postgresql.php.  This file is for people who are using
  PostgreSQL as their database, and provides a function that returns the Django
  username of the logged in user, or null if no-one is logged in.  (Thanks to
  Russ Neufeld for porting this from MySQL.)

* auth_django.php.  This file uses one of the getdjangouser files to  make all
  of your Django users into valid phpBB users.  If someone logs into your site
  using Django, then goes to your forums for the first time, they will be
  automatically registered and logged in to the forums.  When they visit in
  the future, if they are logged into your Django installation they will
  also be logged into phpBB.

* login_body.html.  This is a simple replacement for the login template so that
  when people would normally be presented with a page telling them to log into
  phpBB, they will instead be given a link telling them to log into your
  Django installation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use these:

1. Take a copy of either getdjangouser_mysql.php or
   getdjangouser_postgresql.php, depending on which database you're using, and
   rename it to getdjangouser.php.  Put it somewhere on your PHP include path,
   and modify it to set the DBUSERNAME, DBPASSWORD, and DATABASENAME to match
   the settings for your Django installation.

2. Put auth_django.php inside your phpBB installation, under includes/auth.

3. Modify the links to the login and register pages inside login_body.html to
   match the appropriate ones for your Django installation, then use it to
   replace the login_body.html associated with your current phpBB style
   (probably in styles/something/template).  Make similar changes to
   your template's viewforum_body.html

4. IMPORTANT: edit the file adm/index.php under the phpBB root, and remove the
   lines that require you to log in a second time to go to the administration
   panel; they are (in my version) lines 31-34, and look like this:

     if (!isset($user->data['session_admin']) || !$user->data['session_admin'])
     {
        login_box('', $user->lang['LOGIN_ADMIN_CONFIRM'], $user->lang['LOGIN_ADMIN_SUCCESS'], true, false);
     }


5. Make sure you have a Django user who has the same username as an
   administrator of the phpBB forums.

6. Log into Django as that user.

7. Log into phpBB as that user.

8. Use the phpBB administration panel to set the authentication module to
   auth_django.

That should do the trick!
